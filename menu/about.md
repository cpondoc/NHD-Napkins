title: Welcome to NHD Napkins!
---

I visited the National Museum of Computer Science in the summer of 2018 and bought perhaps my favorite shirt: it's called the "Silicon Valley Napkin", and is a template for everything you would need to start a high-growth tech company in the valley. And -- it was short, concise, and to the point. It was essentially an outline for startups.

NHD Napkins is my attempt at building an outline for National History Day projects. It is a collection of articles and resources designed to help students become more familiar with the National History Day contest, guiding them through everything from crafting the perfect thesis statement to picking the perfect topic.
